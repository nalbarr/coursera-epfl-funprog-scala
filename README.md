This is main repository for [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1)

This is a pre June 2016 launch course and has been since archived and modularized into smaller modules as part of Functional Programming in Scala Specialization.

Instructors:
Martin Odersky, EPFL, Lightbend (formerly Typesafe)

### My Learning Objectives
- Learn from Odersky
- Understand Scala, Typessafe ecosystem, and required tools, etc.
- Evolve towards more pure functional thinking, FP implementations
- Understand and reflect my own Java/C# biases and tendencies and what to improve upon (or eliminate)

### Key Takeaways
- For comprehensions very useful
- SBT and Eclipse, Scale IDE still maturing (this was before Intellij was chosen)
- Much more elegant, concise, and terse as compared with Java but requires different thinking, habits and discipline (e.g., thinking in types, type classes, not using GoF patterns as you would in Java)
